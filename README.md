The main idea is to enable the participation of data owners in the generation of a dataset through a DAO. A token-based incentive for DAO members, i.e., tokenized data structures, can be used to enable participants to work together to build a curated dataset, in pursuit of the instantiation of a decentralized, tokenized data marketplace.
